# Aggregation of Trapezoidal Linguistic Terms

Aggregation of trapezoidal linguistic terms is a computational process used in fuzzy logic and decision-making systems to combine or consolidate multiple linguistic terms represented as trapezoidal membership functions into a single, more comprehensive linguistic representation. This technique is particularly valuable in fields where subjective or expert knowledge needs to be incorporated into quantitative models or systems.
